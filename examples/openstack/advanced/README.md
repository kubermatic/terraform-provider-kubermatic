# OpenStack Advanced Example

This examples shows how to create MetaKube project and deploy Kubernetes cluster on OpenStack using Terraform.

The example shows how to configure and connect with custom network configuration on Openstack. If you need something simpler
please refer to [basic example](./../basic).

To run this example:
1. set up your OpenStack provider credentials. You can do that by downloading and sourcing "OpenStack RC File v3"
   for your account at https://cloud.syseleven.de or configure it manually by uncommenting [corresponding section in
   terraform file](./main.tf#{L12:L23}) configuration.
2. If you sourced "OpenStack RC File v3" please also set `OS_PROJECT` that rc file does not have. You can get project name by running openstack cli `openstack project show $OS_PROJECT_ID -c name`.
3. Configure MetaKube host and token as described in the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/syseleven/metakube/latest/docs)

Running the example
```
terraform init .
terraform apply
```
